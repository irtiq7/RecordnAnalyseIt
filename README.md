# RecordnAnalyseIt
A simple recording tool with GUI to record an audio and display the waveform of the audio file.
*********************************************************
I wrote this program to record an audio from
the source and replay the file as soon as the audio
is recorded. I also wanted to see the waveform of the
audio so that I could introduce noise cancellation
technique in the later part of the project. I am adding
the source code here so that if you are doing something
similar then do let me know. Feel free to use this code
to get yourself started.
